# Variable $sshd_ignore_host is used to filter out hosts that login
# successfully.  This commented-out example filters out reserved local
# addresses (IETF RFC 1918 and RFC 3330).

# The refused connections report lists every ip that is refused even if
# it was only refused 1 or 2 times.  In a case like that I don't care
# to see the information.  It is just noise.  I want to know when a
# a connection has been refused 10, 20, 30 times because that is an
# indication of an attack or a problem.
#   Set this variable to a positive integer to trim out the lower count
# refused connections from the report. i.e. 10 would not show any hosts
# with less than 10 refusals. 
#   This has no effect if the $Detail variable is greater than 5.
#$refused_connections_threshold = 10
