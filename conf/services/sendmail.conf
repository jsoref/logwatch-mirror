# Previous versions of sendmail.conf allowed for the use of the
# $Sendmail_Detail variable.  Because now all services have use
# of the Detail variable, $Sendmail_Detail is deprecated, and may
# be removed in a future version of the sendmail filter script.
# How Detail affects the output of sendmail is described here:
#
# The Detail is used to override the general logwatch Detail
# parameter that is set either when invoking logwatch (option --detail)
# or specified in the conf/logwatch.conf file, in the variable Detail.
# If not specified, the default is to inherit the value of the general
# logwatch Detail setting.
#
# Example:
#Detail = 5
#
# The defined values of Detail are as follows:
# Detail >= 0: Will print:";
#                         - severe errors and basic statistics";
# Detail >= 3: Print above plus:";
#                         - counts of errors handled by sendmail";
# Detail >= 5: Print above plus:";
#                         - details of errors handled by sendmail";
# Detail >= 10: Print above plus:";
#                         - all statistics gathered";

# Note that Detail is independent of sendmail's LogLevel.
# The logwatch script should be able to handle any logging level
# set in sendmail (either through confLOG_LEVEL in the *.mc files
# or through LogLevel in the *.cf files).  The default setting is
# usually a LogLevel of 9.  At level 15, for example, SMTP
# transactions are logged, and the logwatch script extracts additional
# information.  Levels above 15 generate additional debug information,
# which is filtered by the logwatch script.  Therefore, setting higher
# levels of LogLevel will yield larger mail log files, may provide
# additional parsed information in the logwatch log, but should not
# cause new unmatched entries.

# All sendmail log statements that start with "DEBUG: " will be filtered.
# This may be used for user-defined statements that should appear on the log,
# but not reported by logwatch.

# $Sendmail_PrettyHost is used to format host entries in a tabular
# format.  It is mostly useful when you have a very large number of
# entries for errors that display host names/addresses.  If not
# specified, the default is 0, which indicates that no additional
# host formatting is done.  Set to 1 to enable the host formatting.
#$Sendmail_PrettyHost = 0


# The following are examples of the use of variables SendmailMatchFilter,
# Sendmail_ReportFilter, and $Sendmail_MilterHeadersToCount.
# To uncomment and use these specific examples, remember to remove the '#'
# from the first column. And of course, you can write your own filters.
# Note that unlike the statements in the sendmail script, you must end
# each line (except the last one) with a \ to denote a continuation line
