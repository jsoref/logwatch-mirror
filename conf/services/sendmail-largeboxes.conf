# This displays a warning for large mailboxes
# Best solution would be to have a config setting for what the 
# server administrator considers as "large".  Hard coded to consider 40Mb+
# as large.

# You can put comments anywhere you want to.  They are effective for the
# rest of the line.

# this is in the format of <name> = <value>.  Whitespace at the beginning
# and end of the lines is removed.  Whitespace before and after the = sign
# is removed.  Everything is case *insensitive*.

# Yes = True  = On  = 1
# No  = False = Off = 0

# service title
Title = "sendmail-largeboxes (large mail spool files)"

# Which logfile group...
LogFile = NONE

# Mailbox size threshold
#   can add units KB, MB, GB, TB
#   can set to 0 to report spool files being created where they shouldn't

$sendmail_largeboxes_size = 40MB
