# postfix.conf / postfix-logwatch.conf
#
# This is the postfix-logwatch configuration file.

# Lines in this file are of the format:
#
#     VAR = VALUE
#    *VAR = VALUE
#    $VAR = VALUE
#
# Whitespace surrounding the = assignment character is removed.  Variable names
# and values are case insensitive. Double quotes can be used to preserve case and
# whitespace.
#
# Variables beginning with a * are used only by logwatch.
# Variables beginning with a $ are used only by the postfix-logwatch filter.
# Variables beginning with neither * nor $ are used only by logwatch, with the
# exception of the Detail variable which is passed via environment to the
# postfix-logwatch filter.
#
# Any of the equivalent boolean values below may be used where appropriate:
#
#    1, Yes, True,  On
#    0, No,  False, Off
#
# Lines that begin with a # are comment lines.  Blank and whitespace lines
# are ignored.  Whitespace at the beginning and end of a line is ignored.
#

# Specifies the title used in the logwatch report
#
Title = "Postfix"

# Specifies the logwatch logfile group
#
LogFile = maillog

# Specifies the global, maximum detail level
#
#Detail = 10

# The *OnlyService selector is used solely by logwatch to select log lines
# to pass to the postfix-logwatch filter.  And postfix-logwatch uses the
# $postfix_Syslog_Name variable for log line selection.
#
# When used in logwatch, both the *OnlyService and $postfix_Syslog_Name
# variables below should contain essentially the same REs so that lines passed
# by logwatch are also selected by postfix-logwatch.  Note that *OnlyService
# also includes the /<postfix service name> (eg. postfix/smtpd).
#
# If you change postfix's syslog_name for any postfix service, you will need to
# replace "postfix" below with an appropriate RE to capture the desired log entries.
# Do likewise for *OnlyService above when used under logwatch.  For example, the
# settings:
#
#       *OnlyService = "postfix\d?/[-a-zA-Z\d]*"
#       $postfix_Syslog_Name = "postfix\d?"
#
# will capture postfix/smtpd, postfix2/virtual, ..., postfix9/cleanup
#
# Note: If you use parenthesis in your regular expression, be sure they
# are cloistering and not capturing: use (?:pattern) instead of (pattern).
#
# Performance Note:
# If you do not wish to analyze any or all of postgrey, postfwd, or policyd-spf
# consider simplifying $postfix_Syslog_Name to increase log scanning performance. The
# more complex the RE, the longer the scan time to select/reject a log line.  The
# difference in scan times between the simple string 'postfix' and the more complex
# alternation RE that includes postfix, postgrey, postfwd and policyd-spf is about 40%.
#
# Includes: postfix/smtpd, etc, postfix/policy-spf
#*OnlyService = "postfix/[-\w]*"
#$postfix_Syslog_Name = "postfix"
# Includes: postfix/smtpd, etc, postfix/policy-spf, postgrey, postfwd, policyd-spf
*OnlyService         = "(?:post(?:fix|grey|fwd)|policyd-spf)(?:/[-\w]*)?"
$postfix_Syslog_Name = "(?:post(?:fix|grey|fwd)|policyd-spf)"

# Ignored postfix services

# Ignores postfix services postfix/SERVICE, where SERVICE is an RE
# pattern.  The example below will ignore log lines whose syslog
# name is "postfix/myservice".
#$postfix_Ignore_Service = "myservice"

# Specifies the maximum report width for Detail <= 10,

# Specifies the list of reject sections that will be output in
# reports (eg. 5xx permanent or 4xx temporary failures). 
# Each entry in the comma or whitespace separated list consists of 3
# characters, where the first is either 4 or 5, and second and third
# are a digit or a dot "." match-anything character.  Also allowed is
# the keyword "Warn" (which is used for postfix "warn_if_reject" rejects).
# In PCRE (perl regular expression) terms, any pattern that matches:
#
#    ^([45][0-9.][0-9.]|Warn)$
#
# is acceptable.
#
# Typical reject codes:
#
#   421 Service not available, closing transmission channel
#   450 Requested mail action not taken: mailbox unavailable
#   451 Requested action aborted: local error in processing
#   452 Requested action not taken: insufficient system storage
#
#   500 Syntax error, command unrecognized
#   501 Syntax error in parameters or arguments
#   502 Command not implemented
#   503 Bad sequence of commands
#   504 Command parameter not implemented
#   550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable
#   551 User not local; please try <forward-path>
#   552 Requested mail action aborted: exceeded storage allocation
#   553 Requested action not taken: mailbox name not allowed
#   554 Transaction failed
#
# Specific codes take priority over wildcard patterns.  The default list
# is: "5.. 4.. Warn".
#
# See also the various Reject... level limiters below
#
$postfix_Reject_Reply_Patterns = "5.. 4.. Warn"

# Level Limiters
#
# The variables below control the maximum output level for a given
# category.  A level of 1 indicates only one level of detailed output in
# the Detailed report section.  The Summary section is only available
# at logwatch --Detail level >= 5.  Increasing the Detail level
# by one adds one level of additional detail in the Summary section.
#
# For example, Detail 5 would output one additional level of detail,
# Detail 6 two levels, etc. all the way up to 10.  Finally, Detail
# 11 yields uncropped lines of output.
#
# You can control the maximum number of level 1 lines by appending
# a period and a number. The value 2.10 would indicate 2 levels
# of detail, but only 10 level-1 lines.  For example, setting
# $postfix_Sent = 1.20 yields a top 20 list of Messages Sent.
#
# A more  useful form of limiting uses triplets in the form l:n:t.
# This  triplet specifies level l, top n, and minimum threshold t.
# Each of the values are integers, with l being the level  limiter
# as described above, n being a top n limiter for the level l, and
# t being the threshold limiter for level l.  When both  n  and  t
# are  specified, n has priority, allowing top n lists (regardless
# of threshold value).  If the value of l is omitted,  the  speci-
# fied  values for n and/or t are used for all levels available in
# the sub-section.  This permits a simple form of wildcarding (eg.
# place  minimum  threshold  limits on all levels).  However, spe-
# cific limiters always override  wildcard  limiters.   The  first
# form  of  level limiter may be included in levelspec to restrict
# output, regardless of how many triplets are present.
