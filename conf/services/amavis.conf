# Autolearn Report

# default log templates reside), by correctly adding the $log_templ
# variable to the amavisd.conf file.  See amavis' README.customize
# and the end of the amavisd program, searching for "autolearn".

# Level Limiters
#
# The variables below control the maximum output level for a given
# category.  A level of 1 indicates only one level of detailed output
# in the Detailed report section.  The Summary section is only avail-
# able at logwatch --Detail level >= 5.  Increasing the Detail level
# by one adds one level of additional detail in the Summary section.
#
# For example, Detail 5 would output one additional level of detail,
# Detail 6 two levels, etc. all the way up to 10.  Finally, Detail
# 11 yields uncropped lines of output.
#
# You can control the maximum number of level 1 lines by appending
# a period and a number. The value 2.10 would indicate 2 levels
# of detail, but only 10 level 1 lines.  For example, setting
# $amavis_SpamBlocked = 1.20 yields a top 20 list of blocked spam.
#
# A more  useful form of limiting uses triplets in the form l:n:t.
# This  triplet specifies level l, top n, and minimum threshold t.
# Each of the values are integers, with l being the level  limiter
# as described above, n being a top n limiter for the level l, and
# t being the threshold limiter for level l.  When both  n  and  t
# are  specified, n has priority, allowing top n lists (regardless
# of threshold value).  If the value of l is omitted,  the  speci-
# fied  values for n and/or t are used for all levels available in
# the sub-section.  This permits a simple form of wildcarding (eg.
# place  minimum  threshold  limits on all levels).  However, spe-
# cific limiters always override  wildcard  limiters.   The  first
# form  of  level limiter may be included in levelspec to restrict
# output, regardless of how many triplets are present.
